# 🍎 Sweet & Conquer (Python, 2025)

A simulation-based Python project designed to model the "Apple Wars" — a conflict between the **Fire Nation, Earth Kingdom, Water Tribe**, and **Air Nomads**.  
Each faction competes to collect and steal fruits using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

Developed as part of the **AI & Machine Learning Developer Program** at [IT-Högskolan](https://www.iths.se/), Stockholm.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview
- Implements **Classes**, **Methods**, and **Objects** to simulate faction interactions.  
- Focus on **encapsulation**, **inheritance**, and **polymorphism**.  
- Includes randomness, conditional logic, and iterative updates to model the conflict dynamics.  

---

## 🧩 Key Features
- Create and manage multiple factions  
- Simulate fruit collection, loss, and transfer  
- Generate readable output showing the final results of each faction  

---

## ⚙️ Technologies
- **Language:** Python  
- **Concepts:** OOP, Loops, Lists, Conditionals, Random module  
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, GitHub

## 📊 Example Output
```python
Fire Nation stole 30 apples from Earth Kingdom 🍎  
Water Tribe lost 10 bananas to Air Nomads 🍌  
Final Results:
Fire Nation: 120 fruits  
Earth Kingdom: 85 fruits  
Water Tribe: 70 fruits  
Air Nomads: 90 fruits
